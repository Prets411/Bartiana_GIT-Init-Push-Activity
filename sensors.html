    <p><center>A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The input can be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure or any number of other environmental phenomena. <br>
         The output is generally a signal that is converted to a human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing.</center></p>
