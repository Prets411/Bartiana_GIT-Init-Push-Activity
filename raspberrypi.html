    <h1 style="font-size: larger; color: red;">Raspberry Pi</h1>
    <p><center>Raspberry Pi is defined as a minicomputer the size of a credit card that is interoperable with any input and output hardware device like a monitor, a television, a mouse, or a keyboard â€“ effectively converting the set-up into a full-fledged PC at a low cost. <br>
        The first generation of computers came as massive processing systems built with vacuum tube technology. Over the years, more compact and less expensive versions of what a computer would come to look like sprung up. Today, we have minicomputer gadgets such as smartphones in our pockets. Even though computers have become so commonplace, they are still not widely accessible in developing countries. This imbalance in access to computers and programming technology led to the development and creation of the Raspberry Pi computer. <br>
        Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost, single-board computer the size of a credit card that allows people from different backgrounds and levels of expertise to experience and learn to compute. It is an enhanced motherboard developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi foundation, now widely accepted as a part of evolving computer technology. The minicomputer can connect with other peripheral hardware devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and monitor. <br>
        One can use Raspberry Pi for various purposes, including learning programming languages and orchestrating network management. It is multifunctional and gained even more popularity in the past few years than initially projected. </center></p>
